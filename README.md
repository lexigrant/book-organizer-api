# Technologies Used
The technologies used were Heroku, Express, react, node, Atlas(mongodb), axios, postman, Trello.

# Approach Taken

We created an outline of what we wanted to accomplish and we started with the Schema. We created the repos and branches to allow us to work independently. We then setup heroku and Atlas so we were able to see the data and also what the user will view. From this point we divided the were to get our CRUD working and added features as we saw fit. 

# Unsolved Problems

We successfully worked through all of our problems

# user story

As a user I can add books I've read or am hoping to read. I can also put the synopsis and links to audio or purchase if I wish to buy them in the future. 

# notes to self

Stretch goals we didn't reach were organizing titles by alphabetical order and adding a snippet of audio for each book.
